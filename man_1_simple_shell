It displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
The command lines are made only of one word.

When locating a command, this shell first looks to see if it has an executable by that name in the PATH of env. Then it looks for builtin commands by that name.
